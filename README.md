# Refire

Demonstration of the use of Firebase with React. In the initial version this is heavily based on https://sebhastian.com/react-firebase-real-time-database-guide/ .

## Config

This repos is missing the `config.js` file which has the form :

```
const config = {
  apiKey: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
  authDomain: "aaaaaa-99999.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://aaaaaa-99999-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app",
  projectId: "aaaaaa-99999",
  storageBucket: "aaaaaa-99999.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "888888888888",
  appId: "1:222222222222:web:0000000000000000000000"
};

export default config;
```
